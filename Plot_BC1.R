# R script that plots the Log-Likelihood of the logits computed for all the possible lambdas (univariate case).
# The results are taken from the output of the brute force algorithm.
# The best solution is identified by a green dot. Only the "valid" solutions are plot.
#
# The solutions tested by the heuristic can also be plotted, using the output of the "HeuristicVsBruteForce.R" script. The final
# solution of the heuristic is plot in blue if it is different from the (exact) best solution identified by the brute force
# approach.
#
# While being a little bit tricky, a 3D plot is used in order to obtain similar visual outputs as for the
# bivariate and trivariate cases.
